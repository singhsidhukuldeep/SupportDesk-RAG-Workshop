print("""
✅ Agent Architecture Benefits:
   • Tools give the agent structured capabilities
   • Agent decides WHEN and WHICH tool to use
   • More flexible than hardcoded RAG pipelines
   • Can combine multiple tools for complex queries

✅ Tool Design Best Practices:
   • Clear, specific tool descriptions help agent selection
   • Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose
   • Return formatted strings for easy agent consumption
   • Include error handling and helpful messages

✅ Memory Management:
   • Conversation history maintained by passing messages
   • Enables follow-up questions without re-explaining
   • Be mindful of token limits with long conversations
   • Consider summarization for longer chats

✅ When to Use Agentic RAG:
   • Multi-step queries requiring reasoning
   • Need to combine retrieval with other operations
   • Interactive/conversational applications
   • When users need flexible query patterns

✅ When Direct RAG is Better:
   • Simple, single-step retrieval needs
   • Lower latency requirements
   • More predictable/controllable behavior
   • Cost-sensitive applications (agents use more tokens)

🎯 Next Steps:
   1. Try different queries in the exercises
   2. Add custom tools (e.g., ticket creation)
   3. Experiment with different agent prompts
   4. Compare performance vs Module 4's direct RAG
   5. Add evaluation metrics for agent responses
